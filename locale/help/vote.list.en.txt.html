<h4>Voting </h4>
<p>At the beginning of the voting all initiatives will be in the Abstention field. It is recommended to start with your favourite and drag it with your mouse into the Approval field. Then you select the next initiative that you want to approve and drag it either</p>
<ul><li>into the same green box, if you want to approve it equally or</li>
<li>between the Approval and Abstention box, if you want this initiative to be your second choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Continuing like this you define the preference list of the initiatives, that you want to approve, i.e. you drag equal initiatives into the same box. Then you specify your abstentions and disapprovals, meaning that you can also define a preference list for disapprovals, just in case one of the initiatives should represent something like a &bdquo;minor evil&ldquo;.</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> Leave this page via the &bdquo;Finish voting&ldquo; button. You can change your votes anytime until the end of the voting. During the voting no interim results are published. The support data on the issue overview page refers to the single respective initiative and is only suited to a very limited extent to compare different initiatives. Especially, it contains no information whatsoever about preferences. Moreover, the group of those participating in the discussion can be very different from those who actually vote.</p>
<p><b>Notice:</b> On some platforms (e.g. smartphones or tablet computers) &quot;drag and drop&quot; via mouse is not possible. In these cases use the up and down arrows left of each initiative.</p>
