= Subject area =

Here you find:
- **Latest events:** Events in this subject area
- **Open issues:** Issues of this subject area, which are currently open, i.e. new, in discussion, frozen or for voting
- **Closed issues:** Issues of this subject area, where voting has been finished, or which have been canceled
- **Participants:** Eligible voters, who decided to participate in this subject area
- **Delegations:** Delegation settings of other members for this subject area (unit delegations and issue delegations are not listed here)

As long as you're an eligible voter, you can indicate that you want to participate in this subject area. Click on "Participate in this area", if you want to do that. This has the following consequences:
- The subject area will be shown on your homepage under the tab "My areas".
- You are counted for the basic population for issue discussions. This has an impact on the supporter quorum, which initiatives have to reach.
- E-mail notifies about events in the subject area will be sent, as long as your notification settings are configured respectively. Your notification settings can be changed by clicking on "Settings" in the user menu at the upper right corner.

Your delegation of the subject area has an effect on all issues, where no divergent issue delegation has been set by you. When you do not set a delegation in the subject area, your delegation for the organizational unit may be in effect. If you're interested in an issue yourself, then potentially existent delegations will be postponed until voting. Voting on an issue cancels an existent delegation.
