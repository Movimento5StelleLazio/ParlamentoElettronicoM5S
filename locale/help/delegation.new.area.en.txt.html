<h4>Delegation for this area </h4>
<p>You can delegate your vote for this area (independent of your membership in the area) to a person on your contact list. This delegation takes precedence over a potentially existing global delegation, but only, if you don't participate yourself and if you have not given a issue-specific delegation for the respective issue. Please go to the respective issue page for making issue-specific delegations.</p>
<p><b>Notice:</b> You can only delegate to members, who you have added to your list of contacts. You can find other members under the tabulator &ldquo;Eligible voters&rdquo; in their corresponding unit. Click on the member to visit their member page, then click on &ldquo;Add to my contacts&rdquo; to add this member to your personal contact list.</p>
