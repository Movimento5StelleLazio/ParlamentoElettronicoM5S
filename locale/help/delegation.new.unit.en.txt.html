<h4>Unit delegation </h4>
<p>A unit delegation is always active if you don't participate yourself and there is no delegation on the level of the respective area or issue. Note that unit delegations for a superordinate unit are not automatically inherited to subdivisions.</p>
<p><b>Notice:</b> You can only delegate to members, who you have added to your list of contacts. You can find other members under the tabulator &ldquo;Eligible voters&rdquo; in their corresponding unit. Click on the member to visit their member page, then click on &ldquo;Add to my contacts&rdquo; to add this member to your personal contact list.</p>
